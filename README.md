Learning Challenge (BeCode assignment)

It was my first time to create game with js, but actually this was not as difficult as I expected.
After I finished this assignment, I got a little bit more confidence of my js skill. 

## My first game app
This was my really first game creation. I was worried if I could make it before I tried, but it was actually fun and I made it! I know it is not a great one, but it gave me a bit more confidence of my coding skill :)
